DESCRIPTION
  "This MIB module defines textual conventions for
   representing Internet addresses. An Internet
   address can be an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address
   or a DNS domain name."

InetAddressType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  STATUS      current
  DESCRIPTION
      "A value that represents a type of Internet address.

       unknown(0)  An unknown address type. This value MUST
                   be used if the value of the corresponding
                   InetAddress object is a zero-length string.
                   It may also be used to indicate an IP address
                   which is not in one of the formats defined
                   below.

       ipv4(1)     An IPv4 address as defined by the
                   InetAddressIPv4 textual convention.

       ipv6(2)     An IPv6 address as defined by the
                   InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.

       dns(16)     A DNS domain name as defined by the
                   InetAddressDNS textual convention.

       Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
       accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
       with that InetAddressType.

       The InetAddressType textual convention SHOULD NOT be subtyped
       in object type definitions to support future extensions. It

       MAY be subtyped in compliance statements in order to require
       only a subset of these address types for a compliant
       implementation."

InetAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  STATUS       current
  DESCRIPTION
      "Denotes a generic Internet address.

       An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the
       context of an InetAddressType value. The InetAddressType
       object which defines the context must be registered
       immediately before the object which uses the InetAddress
       textual convention. In other words, the object identifiers
       for the InetAddressType object and the InetAddress object
       MUST have the same length and the last sub-identifier of
       the InetAddressType object MUST be 1 less than the last
       sub-identifier of the InetAddress object.

       When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
       index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
       sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58. In this case,
       the OBJECT-TYPE declaration MUST include a 'SIZE' clause
       to limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers."

InetAddressIPv4 ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  DISPLAY-HINT "1d.1d.1d.1d"
  STATUS       current
  DESCRIPTION
      "Represents an IPv4 network address:

         octets   contents         encoding
          1-4     IP address       network-byte order

       The corresponding InetAddressType value is ipv4(1)."
  SYNTAX       OCTET STRING (SIZE (4))

InetAddressIPv6 ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  DISPLAY-HINT "2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x%4d"
  STATUS       current
  DESCRIPTION
      "Represents an IPv6 network address:

         octets   contents         encoding
          1-16    IPv6 address     network-byte order
         17-20    scope identifier network-byte order

       The corresponding InetAddressType value is ipv6(2).

       The scope identifier (bytes 17-20) MUST NOT be present
       for global IPv6 addresses. For non-global IPv6 addresses
       (e.g. link-local or site-local addresses), the scope
       identifier MUST always be present. It contains a link
       identifier for link-local and a site identifier for
       site-local IPv6 addresses.

       The scope identifier MUST disambiguate identical address
       values. For link-local addresses, the scope identifier will
       typically be the interface index (ifIndex as defined in the
       IF-MIB, RFC 2233) of the interface on which the address is
       configured.

       The scope identifier may contain the special value 0
       which refers to the default scope. The default scope
       may be used in cases where the valid scope identifier
       is not known (e.g., a management application needs to
       write a site-local InetAddressIPv6 address without
       knowing the site identifier value). The default scope
       SHOULD NOT be used as an easy way out in cases where
       the scope identifier for a non-global IPv6 is known."

InetAddressDNS ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  DISPLAY-HINT "255a"
  STATUS       current
  DESCRIPTION
      "Represents a DNS domain name. The name SHOULD be
       fully qualified whenever possible.

       The corresponding InetAddressType is dns(16).

       The DESCRIPTION clause of InetAddress objects that
       may have InetAddressDNS values must fully describe
       how (and when) such names are to be resolved to IP
       addresses."
